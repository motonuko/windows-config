# Chrome
## Extensions
- vimium

## Tips
### vimium doesn't work default new tab.
Just don't keep it except just after creating new tab. If you want to search bookmarks on new tab, you can't use vimium "b", but normal address bar search. That's enough in my opinion. `Ctrl + l` is nice in this situation.

You can also change default page by using chrome extension. But maybe it is a little bit slow.
